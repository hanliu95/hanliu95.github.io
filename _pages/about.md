About Me
------
I am currently a Research Fellow with [Prof. Shiqi Wang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~shiqwang/index.html) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I obtained my Ph.D. from the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.en.qd.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Shandong University. My research interests lie primarily in multimedia search and recommendation. I was a visiting scholar at [NExT++@NUS](https://www.nextcenter.org/) in 2022.
